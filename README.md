## Source distribution

This section explains how to compile Enki from the source distribution.

### Prerequisites

To compile Enki and programs who depend on it, you need:
* a working and fairly recent c++ compiler
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* A build environment compatible with CMake.
* QT5

### Enki simulator compilation under Unix (library)

Those short instructions assume that you want to use "make" to build Enki.

	cmake .

and then build Enki by running:

	make

### Graphical frontend (QT5) compilation to view the robots

In order to compile the QT based GUI, called "Viewer", you need to go to the subdir "viewer" and
do `qmake`, `make` and `sudo make install`.

### Compiling/running the graphical demo (QT5) "playground"

To compile the demo "playground" you need to do again `qmake` and `make`. This uses the
previously compiled libraries.

To run it type "./playground ./track.png" which loads the playground with a sample track
painted on the floor!

### Use

Check out `playground.pro` in the subdir "playground" to see how to compile your own project.

## Documentation

HTML documentation (including examples and cookbooks) can be generated by the
`doc` target of the build system.  Doxygen tool can be downloaded from
http://www.doxygen.org/
